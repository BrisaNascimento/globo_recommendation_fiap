# Overview :wave:

This project is about developing a machine learning model for personalized news recommendations tailored to each user's preferences and behavior. The goal is to provide a seamless and engaging user experience by delivering content that aligns with individual interests.

The development stages of the project are as follows:

1. **Model Training**: Use historical data on user interactions and news content to train a machine learning model capable of making accurate recommendations.
2. **Model Saving**: Save the trained model in a standardized format, ensuring it can be efficiently loaded and used during inference.
3. **API Creation for Predictions**: Develop a RESTful API to serve predictions, enabling the model to recommend news articles dynamically.
4. **Packaging with Docker**: Containerize the API and its dependencies using Docker, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
5. **API Testing and Validation**: Perform rigorous testing to validate the APIâ€™s performance, scalability, and accuracy in providing recommendations.
6. **Deployment in a Production Environment**: Deploy the containerized application to a cloud-based or on-premises infrastructure, ensuring it can handle real-world traffic and deliver a high-quality user experience.
