## **API**: 

!Draft: Describe the API you will create for making predictions with the trained model. Include the endpoints, input/output format, and how users will interact with it. 

## **Packaging with Docker**: 

!Draft: Explain how Docker will be used to containerize the application for easier deployment and scalability. Include the Dockerfile's main components, such as the base image, dependencies, and commands to run the API.

## **API Testing and Validation**:

!Draft: Detail the testing process for the API to ensure accuracy and reliability. Discuss unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests to validate the API under various scenarios. Highlight how you will simulate user inputs and validate that predictions are consistent and accurate.
